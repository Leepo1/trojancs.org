So if one light blows out, the whole circuit will fail.\nLights in series: If the lights are in parallel, it means that they branch off from the main circuit in their own sort of mini circuits, and the current does not have to travel through the light itself in order to reach the next. If a light blows out in this circuit, it will not affect other parts of the main circuit.\nLights in parallel: There are many uses for both types of circuit.\n"});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/students/logan/analog-circuits/','title':"Analog Circuits",'section':"Logan",'content':"Tinkercad #  This week we created a few circuits in Tinkercad to explore the basics of circuits. We learned about 3 varieties of circuits, series, parallel, and analog. Series circuits require all resistors to be arrange such that the current only can take one path. Parallel circuits are different, arranging resistors such that instead of taking one path, it can take many simultaneously, and if one resistor is removed or damage, the others will continue to function as normal. Analog circuits are circuits which include signals that can be changed variably in a continuious, rather than binary (digital) fashion. Analog circuits can be either in series or parallel.\nThis is a basic series circuit. As you can see, the LEDs are arranged on the breadboard such that current can only flow in one path through them.\nTinkercad link\nThis is a basic parallel circuit. The current has multiple paths to flow through, so if one LED burnt out, the others would continue to provide light.\nTinkercad link #  Tinkercad link:\nIn this project, we created an analog circuit that would light up different lights based on the value of the adjustable resistor.
