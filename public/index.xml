      <description>Stoplight Setup (RYG)#Just like a regular stoplight, this arduino stoplight can switch between its red, yellow, and green leds. However, unlike a normal stoplight, this one uses a distance sensor to detect how far away it is from an object, and changes which led is lit based on the distance.
  Additionally, like a normal stoplight, this circuit has the ability to change to a blinking red light when the push button is pressed.</description>

      <description>3d Modeling/Printing Workshop#Fill out this form to register! After you register, go ahead and download Fusion 360, the modeling software we&amp;rsquo;ll be using. Get it by signing up for an Autodesk Education account If you run into any problems, please see Dr. Taylor before the day of the workshop. This is very important, there won&amp;rsquo;t be time to troubleshoot during the event.

      <description>Arduino Circuits#Virtual Learning#In this project, we created an analog circuit that would light up different lights based on the value of the adjustable resistor. We accomplished this with some basic code on an Arduino as well as the circuit you can see above. Below is the block code used on the virtual Arduino. Tinkercad link
Real Arduino#Afterwards, we were able to create this circuit with a real Arduino, and program it on our own!</description>

      <description>STOPLIGHTS
SERIES VERSUS PARALLEL#Say we have a part of a circuit with a string of LED lights.
If those lights are in series, it means the current must pass through the light in order to continue through the circuit and get to the next one. So if one light blows out, the whole circuit will fail.
Lights in series: If the lights are in parallel, it means that they branch off from the main circuit in their own sort of mini circuits, and the current does not have to travel through the light itself in order to reach the next.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the first page of my documented journey through the basics of Mechatronics! We did 2 things this week, learning about the basics of electricity, including current, voltage, and resistance as well as 2 main types of circuits.
Basics#Current: Current is the rate of flow of electrons through a circuit, and is measured in amperage (amps). If you think of the circuit as a loop of water, the current is the speed of the water.</description>

      <description>Series VS Parallel Circuits:# An Intoduction to Breadboards:#For all the examples below, I am using a breadboard to house my LEDs and complete my circuit, if I was not using a breadboard, I would be using wires to do the same thing. A breadboard is basically a tool in order to simplify a circuit.
A current will always run heightwise(for this example), or along the numbered columns.</description>

      <description>SWITCHES#My goal was to use the pushbutton as a switch, so that when you pressed down, the output would change and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t change again until the button was released and then pressed again.
bool buttonPressed = false;bool beenPressed = false;bool flashing = false;void loop() {if (digitalRead(2) == LOW) {buttonPressed = true;} else {buttonPressed = false;beenPressed = false;}if (buttonPressed == true &amp;amp;&amp;amp; beenPressed == false) {flashing = !</description>
