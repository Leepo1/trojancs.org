      <description>Stoplight Setup (RYG) #  Just like a regular stoplight, this arduino stoplight can switch between its red, yellow, and green leds. However, unlike a normal stoplight, this one uses a distance sensor to detect how far away it is from an object, and changes which led is lit based on the distance.
  Additionally, like a normal stoplight, this circuit has the ability to change to a blinking red light when the push button is pressed.</description>

      <description>Series VS Parallel Circuits: #   An Intoduction to Breadboards: #  For all the examples below, I am using a breadboard to house my LEDs and complete my circuit, if I was not using a breadboard, I would be using wires to do the same thing. A breadboard is basically a tool in order to simplify a circuit.
A current will always run heightwise(for this example), or along the numbered columns.</description>
