      <description>STOPLIGHTS
SERIES VERSUS PARALLEL#Say we have a part of a circuit with a string of LED lights.
If those lights are in series, it means the current must pass through the light in order to continue through the circuit and get to the next one. So if one light blows out, the whole circuit will fail.
Lights in series: If the lights are in parallel, it means that they branch off from the main circuit in their own sort of mini circuits, and the current does not have to travel through the light itself in order to reach the next.</description>

      <description>SWITCHES#My goal was to use the pushbutton as a switch, so that when you pressed down, the output would change and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t change again until the button was released and then pressed again.
bool buttonPressed = false;bool beenPressed = false;bool flashing = false;void loop() {if (digitalRead(2) == LOW) {buttonPressed = true;} else {buttonPressed = false;beenPressed = false;}if (buttonPressed == true &amp;amp;&amp;amp; beenPressed == false) {flashing = !</description>
