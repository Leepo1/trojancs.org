      <description>Arduino Circuits #  Virtual Learning #  In this project, we created an analog circuit that would light up different lights based on the value of the adjustable resistor. We accomplished this with some basic code on an Arduino as well as the circuit you can see above. Below is the block code used on the virtual Arduino. Tinkercad link
Real Arduino #  Afterwards, we were able to create this circuit with a real Arduino, and program it on our own!</description>

      <description>Welcome to the first page of my documented journey through the basics of Mechatronics! We did 2 things this week, learning about the basics of electricity, including current, voltage, and resistance as well as 2 main types of circuits.
Basics #  Current: Current is the rate of flow of electrons through a circuit, and is measured in amperage (amps). If you think of the circuit as a loop of water, the current is the speed of the water.</description>
