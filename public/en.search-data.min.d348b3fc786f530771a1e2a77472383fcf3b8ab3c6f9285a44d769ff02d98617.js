We did 2 things this week, learning about the basics of electricity, including current, voltage, and resistance as well as 2 main types of circuits.\nBasics #  Current: Current is the rate of flow of electrons through a circuit, and is measured in amperage (amps). If you think of the circuit as a loop of water, the current is the speed of the water.\nVoltage: Voltage is the power of the current, or how much work the electricity in the circuit can do, and is measured between two points on the circuit. In terms of our analogy, the voltage is the water pressure. Voltage is provided by the power source of a circuit.\nResistance: Resistance is the opposition to the flow of electrons in a circuit, and can be measured in ohms. Resistors are objects which provide resistance in a circuit, such as resistors, which convert electrical energy into heat energy, or lightbulbs, which convert electricity into heat and light. In our water analogy, a resistor would be like a water wheel, changing the water\u0026rsquo;s momentum into something usable.\nThese 3 basic electrical terms can be related with Ohm\u0026rsquo;s Law, V=IR, where voltage (V) is proportional to current (I) times resistance (R)\nTinkercad #  We created a few circuits in Tinkercad to explore the basics of circuits. We learned about 3 varieties of circuits, series, parallel, and analog. Series circuits require all resistors to be arrange such that the current only can take one path. Parallel circuits are different, arranging resistors such that instead of taking one path, it can take many simultaneously, and if one resistor is removed or damage, the others will continue to function as normal. Analog circuits are circuits which include signals that can be changed variably in a continuious, rather than binary (digital) fashion. Analog circuits can be either in series or parallel.\nThis is a basic series circuit. As you can see, the LEDs are arranged on the breadboard such that current can only flow in one path through them.\nTinkercad link\nThis is a basic parallel circuit. The current has multiple paths to flow through, so if one LED burnt out, the others would continue to provide light.\nTinkercad link\nBuilding Circuits #  After building these in Tinkercad, we created one of them with a breadboard hands on!\nNote that in the first picture the LEDs are not lit up, this is because I unplugged the negative wire in order to better show the wiring. "});index.add({'id':9,'href':'/students/william/analog-circuits/','title':"Analog Circuits",'section':"William",'content':"Series VS Parallel Circuits: #   An Intoduction to Breadboards: #  For all the examples below, I am using a breadboard to house my LEDs and complete my circuit, if I was not using a breadboard, I would be using wires to do the same thing. A breadboard is basically a tool in order to simplify a circuit.\nA current will always run heightwise(for this example), or along the numbered columns. This rule works for everything but the (-) and (+) terminals, in which current runs lengthwise. These two terminals are also specifically for the (+) and (-) charge specifically, while the numbered rows can be used for either.\nSeries Circuits #  A series circuit is a circuit that depends on each item in the chain in order for current to flow, making the circuit work.\nShould one item in the circuit be removed or fail, then the whole circuit will be disconnected. Should this happen, current will not run through it, resulting in nothing happening when connected to a power source.\nFor this example, one can see that the circuit is disconnected because, when the LED is taken out, it stops the first LED from connecting to the third LED. The (-) end of the first LED is now only running on column 9, while the (+) end of the third LED is on the 8th column.\nParallel Circuit #  In contrast, a parallel circuit is one that work even if an item is removed. In both situations, the LED lights are the items being removed. In the series circuit, the circuit is broken with the removal of the LED, causing nothing to happen.\nFor a parallel circuit, when the LED is removed, the circuit is not broken because it is still connected to the other LEDs, thus retaining the property of a complete circuit. For the example below, both (+) end of the LEDs are connected to the power source through column 10, and both (-) ends are connected on column 9, making it a completed circuit.\n"});index.add({'id':10,'href':'/students/william/','title':"William",'section':"Students",'content':"William #  Mechatronics Portfolio #   Analog Circuits Stoplight  "});index.add({'id':11,'href':'/students/logan/','title':"Logan",'section':"Students",'content':"Logan #  Mechatronics Portfolio #  Welcome to my Mechatronics Portfolio!

To detect when it changes, I used a variable to keep track of what the signal was on the last loop. If that variable is LOW and the current one is HIGH, then the boolean switches.\nRange Finders #  So basically I learned how ultrasonic distance sensors work. A short signal gets send to the distance sensor. When the sensor receives it, it sensor sends out a freq that will go out, bounce off something, and return. When they return, a the sensor will send back a signal. If the object is farther away, it will take longer for the waves to hit it and bounce back, so it will take longer to send the return signal. So depending on how long the signal takes to come back, you can find how far away the object is.\nSo basically here:\ntinkercad photo\n"});index.add({'id':19,'href':'/xplore21w1/','title':"xPlore 2021 Week 1",'section':"Home",'content':"xPlore 2021 Week 1 #  Welcome.\n"});})();
