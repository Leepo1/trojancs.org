# Arduino Circuits

## Virtual Learning

![image](../images/stoplight.png)

In this project, we created an analog circuit that would light up different lights based on the value of the adjustable resistor. We accomplished this with some basic code on an Arduino as well as the circuit you can see above. Below is the block code used on the virtual Arduino.

## Real Arduino

Afterwards, we were able to create this circuit with a real Arduino, and program it on our own!
