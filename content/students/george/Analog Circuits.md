STOPLIGHTS





# SERIES VERSUS PARALLEL

Say we have a part of a circuit with a string of LED lights.

If those lights are in series, it means the current must pass through the light in order to continue through the circuit and get to the next one. So if one light blows out, the whole circuit will fail.

Lights in series:

If the lights are in parallel, it means that they branch off from the main circuit in their own sort of mini circuits, and the current does not have to travel through the light itself in order to reach the next. If a light blows out in this circuit, it will not affect other parts of the main circuit.

Lights in parallel:

There are many uses for both types of circuit.

We usage a pententiometer to send a variable signal level, from 0 to 1023. If we use some code to read the voltage, you can light a certain LED depending on where the pent. is. 

Push button as well. When the button is up, no current travels through so it doesn't affect the circuit. But when it's down, current can pass through and lights up every LED.
