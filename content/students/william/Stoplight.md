# Stoplight Setup (RYG)


Just like a regular stoplight, this arduino stoplight can switch between its red, yellow, and green leds.
However, unlike a normal stoplight, this one uses a distance sensor to detect how far away it is from an
object, and changes which led is lit based on the distance.

Additionally, like a normal stoplight, this circuit has the ability to change to a blinking red light when
the push button is pressed. It will change back to a normal stoplight when the button is pressed again.
