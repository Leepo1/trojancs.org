# Creating the Puppet

	In order to create my puppet of Jekyll and Hyde, I used a couple of servos to animate my object. I did this
to represent the dual-faced nature of the character, while using the other servo to depict the process in which
he changes form, a potion. To activate the animation, I set up a distance sensor which activates when something gets close
enough to the front of my puppet.Additionally, I used LEDs to represent the different characters, as well as the
transition between the two faces(but only for Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde). In order to get the actual form of my character, I used a lasercutter,
along with an online picture I found for both forms, to cut out their forms.
