Series VS Parallel Circuits:

A series circuit is a circuit that depends on each item in the chain in order for current to flow, making the circuit work.

Should one item in the circuit be removed or fail, then the whole circuit will be disconnected.
Should this happen, current will not run through it, resulting in nothing happening when connected to a power source.

In contrast, a parallel circuit is one that work even if an item is removed. In both situations, the LED lights are the items
being removed. In the series circuit, the circuit is broken with the removal of the LED, causing nothing to happen.

For a parallel circuit, when the LED is removed, the circuit is not broken because it is still connected to the other LEDs,
thus retaining the propert of a complete circuit.
