> I learned how to make many different shapes and how to color those shapes. I used rect to make my arms, mouth, eyebrows, teeth, legs, and hair, I then used stroke in order to color the rectangles. I also used commands like point to make the body and the eyes, and used strokeweight to make the point bigger or smaller. After creating my monster I feel very accomplished.
